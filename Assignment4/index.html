			<h1>My favorite pet</h1>
			<p>My favorite pet is my hamster.</p>
			<h2>Some basic info</h2>
			<p>My pet is a hamster. His name is Big Brother. I bought him from Petmart last year. He has beautiful grey fur all over its body. Big Brother is one perfect pet. He gives me accompany when I feel I need some but He does not acquire as much attention as dogs or cats do. Also It is much cheaper to have hamster than to have other pets.</p>
			<h2>Some annoying habits</h2>
			<p>Although I love Big Brother very much, He still pisses me off sometimes. For example, He always chews on cages when I try to get sleep. This kind of behavior can be really annoying during midterm or final period.</p>

			<h2>Tips</h2>
			<p>If you are considering to have a hamster as a pet, one thing you need to be aware is that hamster does not get along with another hamster. They will breed like crazy and eat the weakest ones. So to avoid this kind of brutal scenarios, make sure to keep each hamster into independent cage.</p>
